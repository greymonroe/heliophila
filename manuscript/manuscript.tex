\abstract{
Explaining variation in life history strategies is a long-standing goal
of evolutionary biology. For plants, annual and perennial life histories
are thought to reflect adaptation to environments that differ in the
frequency of environmental stress such as drought. Here we test this
hypothesis in \textit{Heliophila} (Brassicaceae), a diverse genus of
flowering plants native to Africa by integrating 2192 herbaria
occurrence records with 34 years of satellite-based drought detection.
Consistent with predictions from classic life history theory, we find
that perennial \textit{Heliophila} species occur in environments where
droughts are significantly less frequent compared to annuals. These
associations are predictive while controlling for phylogeny, lending
support to the hypothesis that drought related natural selection has
influenced the distributions of these strategies. Additionally, the
difference in drought frequency between annual and perennial species
distributions is greatest during the summer and fall, which also appears
to be when annuals are in the seed phase of their life cycle based on
collection dates of annual species. Together, these finding provide
empirical support for classic hypotheses about the drivers of life
history strategy in plants - that perennials out compete annuals in
environments with less frequent drought and that annuals are adpated to
enviroments with more frequent drought by escaping drought prone seasons
as seeds.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Understanding the causes and consequences of life history variation is a
longstanding goal of ecology and evolutionary biology (Cole, 1954). In
plants, life histories are especially diverse, with herbaceous species
that complete their life cycle in a number of weeks to trees that live
for thousands of years (Brown, 1996). Along this continuum an important
division exists, distinguishing annuals (i.e.~monocarpic or semelparous)
which complete their seed to seed life cycle within a single calendar
year from perennials (i.e.~polycarpic or iteroparous) which can persist
over multiple years. Annual plants flower once, set seed, senesce, and
then die, spending at least some portion of the year as a seed, where
they are relatively protected from environmental stress. In contrast,
perennial plants can continue vegetative growth after reproduction and
must survive conditions experienced during all seasons. These represent
fundamentally different life history strategies, but the ecological
factors that explain their evolution and distributions remain
empirically uresolved (Friedman \& Rubin, 2015).\\
Classical theory predict shorter life spans in environments where adult
mortality is high (Charnov \& Schaffer, 1973; Franco \& Silvertown,
1996; Stearns, 1992). In plants, this has been extended to the
hypothessis that annuality is adaptive when it allows plants to escape
drought (Schaffer \& M, 1975). Lack of water is perhaps the greatest
threat to survival during vegetatitive or reproductive growth and
annuals can remain dormant (and protected as a seed) during drought.
Thus, environments with greater seasonal drought frequency may select
for annual life histories that complete reproduction prior to drought
prone seasons. Conversely, environments with less frequent drought may
select for perennial species, which may benefit from multiple bouts of
reproduction and competitive advantage by preventing recruitment of
annual species (Corbin \& D'Antonio, 2004). These predictions have been
supported by the association of annualilty with arid environments in
wild rice (Morishima, Sano, \& Oka, 1984) and \emph{Oenothera} (Evans,
Hearn, Hahn, Spangle, \& Venable, 2005). Additionally, annual and
perennial species of \emph{Nemesia} were qualitatively associated with
winter rather and summer rainfall environments respectively (Datson,
Murray, \& Steiner, 2008) and annual species of \emph{Scorzoneroides}
were associated with environments classified as unpredictable
(Cruz-Mazo, Buide, Samuel, \& Narbona, 2009). However, whether the
history frequency of drought events indeed predicts the distributions
annual or perennial life history strategies has yet to be tested in a
phylogenetic context with suitable sample sizes of distrubution and
climate data.\\
Here we combine a long-term global dataset of satellite detected drought
events with metadata from natural collections to test these classic
hypotheses about the evolution of life history strategies within the
African endemic mustard genus, \emph{Heliophila} L. (Brassicaceae). If
annuallity is an adaptive strategy allowing plants to escape drought
prone seasons, then drought frequency should predict the distribution of
life history strategies across landscapes, and annual species should be
more commonly associated with drought prone regions than perennial
species. Furthermore, if annual species have adapted to escape drought
prone seasons as seeds, observations of annual species should be rare
during drought prone seasons. Phylogenetic relatedness can have
significant non-random effects on species distributions and life history
traits (Barrett, Harder, \& Worley, 1996), and therefore we assessed the
relationship between life history distribution and drought frequency in
a phylogenetically controlled background.

\hypertarget{satellite-detected-drought-data}{%
\subsubsection{Satellite-detected drought
data}\label{satellite-detected-drought-data}}

Remotely sensed data is a powerful tool for characterizing seasonal
patterns in drought because it is less limited in spatial and temporal
scope and resolution than weather stations or field observations
(AghaKouchak et al., 2015). To quantify the frequency of drought during
different seasons across landscapes, we used the remotely sensed
Vegetative Health Index (VHI), which measures landscape scale reductions
in plant cover and temperature conditions characteristic of drought
(Kogan, 2001). Generated from data collected by NOAA AVHRR satellites
since 1981, the VHI combines normalized difference vegetation index
(NDVI) derived measures of vegetative stress (Vegetative Condition Index
- VCI) with temperature stress indicated by anomalies in thermal spectra
(Temperature Condition Index - TCI). The VHI of year \(y\) during week
\(w\) of \([1,52]\) at pixel \(i\) is derived from the following
equations, where \(n\) is the number of years observed.

\[VCI_{y,w,i} = 100\frac{NDVI_{y,w,i} - NDVI_{min}}{NDVI_{max} - NDVI_{min}}\]

where \(NDVI_{min} = min(NDVI_{1981,w,i}...NDVI_{1981+n,w,i})\) and
\(NDVI_{max} = max(NDVI_{1981,w,i}...NDVI_{1981+n,w,i})\)

\[TCI_{y,w,i} = 100\frac{T_{y,w,i} - T_{min}}{T_{max} - T_{min}}\]

where \(T_{min} = min(T_{1981,w,i}...T_{1981+n,w,i})\) and
\(T_{max} = max(T_{1981,w,i}...T_{1981+n,w,i})\)

\[VHI_{y,w,i} = 0.5(VCI_{y,w,i}) + 0.5(TCI_{y,w,i})\] Thus, VHI
measurements are standardized according to conditions historically
observed at each locations. These measurements have been validated and
generally used for evaluating drought risk and predicting crop yields in
agriculture (e.g., Rojas, Vrieling, \& Rembold, 2011; Kogan et al.,
2016). But they also present a new tool to study seasonal patterns in
the frequency of drought across environments and to test hypotheses
about the effect of drought on ecological and evolutionary processes
(Kerr \& Ostrovsky, 2003). As such, the VHI has been applied recently to
study drought related ecology of natural species and proven useful for
predicting infraspecific variation in drought tolerance traits and genes
(Dittberner et al., 2018; Mojica et al., 2016; Monroe et al., 2018).
Here, we accessed VHI data at \(16km^2\) resolution from 1981 to 2015
(\url{https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/emb/vci/VH/vh_ftp.php}) to
characterize the seasonal drought frequencies experienced by annual and
perennial \emph{Heliophila} species.

\hypertarget{life-history-data-for-heliophila}{%
\subsubsection{Life history data for
Heliophila}\label{life-history-data-for-heliophila}}

\emph{Heliophila} is a genus of flowering plants endemic to the southern
portion of Africa including the Cape Floristic and Succulent Karoo
Regions. These are among the most botanically diverse environments on
Earth and the estimated \textasciitilde{}50 \emph{Heliophila} species
are considered to be the most diverse genus of the family Brassicaceae
(Mummenhoff, Al-Shehbaz, Bakker, Linder, \& Mühlhausen, 2005). This
genus includes both perennial and annual species and this change in life
history strategy has likely arisen multiple independent times (Appel \&
Al-Shehbaz, 1997; Mummenhoff et al., 2005). Furthermore, the fine scale
climatic heterogeneity of Southern Africa is ideal for studying the
distribution of traits in relation to environmental parameters (Sayre et
al., 2013). We used life histories reported by Mummenhoff et al. (2005),
grouping species with annual or perennial life histories. Perenniality
was defined based any form of perennial life history (e.g., herbs,
shrubs, mixed, etc). We also repeated these analyses without \emph{H.
subulata} and \emph{H. minima} which have mixed life histories and found
similar results. Because the original authors didn't report the nature
of the mixed trait (Mummenhoff et al., 2005), (ie. plasticity
vs.~genetic variation), we classified these species here as perennial
since they have the capacity to maintain vegetative growth after
reproduction at least to some capacity.

\hypertarget{heliophila-occurance-records}{%
\subsubsection{Heliophila occurance
records}\label{heliophila-occurance-records}}

Botanists have collected and maintained over 350 million botanical
specimens worldwide over the past 300 years. Herbarium specimens and
their associated metadata have been used since the 1960s to study
species' geographical distributions (reviewed by Willis et al. (2017)
and Lang, Willems, Scheepens, Burbano, and Bossdorf (2018)). And as they
become digitized (Soltis, 2017), these collections have been used to
study relationships between trait distributions, geography, and climate
(Davis, Willis, Connolly, Kelly, \& Ellison, 2015; Stropp et al., 2016;
Václavı'k, Beckmann, Cord, \& Bindewald, 2017; Wolf, Zimmerman,
Anderegg, Busby, \& Christensen, 2016). To characterize the diributions
of annual and perennial \emph{Heliophila} species, all records for the
genus \emph{Heliophila} were downloaded from the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (gbif.org) on July 21, 2018 (``GBIF occurrence
download,'' 2018).

\hypertarget{sequence-data-for-phylogeny}{%
\subsubsection{Sequence data for

Aligned Heliophila ITS sequences were obtained from previous work by
Mandáková et al. (2012). Aethionema, Alliaria, Cardamine, Chamira, and
Rorippa ITS records from were downloaded from Genbank.

\hypertarget{drought-frequency-calculations}{%
\subsubsection{Drought frequency
calculations}\label{drought-frequency-calculations}}

To characterize drought regimens across the distrubtions of annual and
perennial species of \emph{Heliohpila}, we calculated drought during
different seasons at the location of observations for \emph{Heliophila}
records using the VHI. Specifically, we created global maps of the
frequencies of observing drought conditions (VHI\textless{}40, NOAA)
during the winter (quarter surrounding winter solstice), spring (quarter
surrounding spring equinox), summer (quarter surrounding summer
solstice) and fall (quarter surrounding fall equinox) from 1981 to 2015.
From these maps, the drought frequency during the winter, spring,
summer, and fall were extracted for the locations of all GBIF records.

\hypertarget{filtering-of-occurance-records}{%
\subsubsection{Filtering of occurance
records}\label{filtering-of-occurance-records}}

To avoid instances with spurious location data, we filtered raw GBIF by
restricting our analyses to include only:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Records for species with reported life history\\
\item
  Records with geospatial data\\
\item
  Records without known geospatial issues (i.e., coordinates reported
  are those of herbarium)\\
\item
  Records from collection sites classified as land pixels\\
\item
  Records from Africa\\
\item
  Records without duplicates (i.e., identical species, location,
  collection date)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{phylogeny-construction}{%
\subsubsection{Phylogeny construction}\label{phylogeny-construction}}

Out group species were aligned together with \emph{Heliophila} ITS
sequences using MAFFT. Model selection for construction of phylogeny was
performed in jModeltest2 with CIPRES. Based on this analysis,
\(GTR + L\) were selected. Ultrametric phylogeny was estimated with
branch lengths as relative time.

\subsubsection{Comparison of drought frequency between annual and
perennial
species}\label{comparison-of-drought-frequency-between-annual-and-perennial-species}}

To evaluate the hypothesis that annual and perennial life history
strategies reflect adaptations to alternative drought regimes, we tested
the corresponding prediction that the observed distributions of annual
and perennial \emph{Heliophila} species would be significantly
associated with historic drought frequency. First, we compared the
frequency of drought during the winter, spring, summer, and fall between
raw occurance records of annual and perennial species by t-tests. To
account for variation in the number of occurance records per species, we
next calculated the mean drought frequency during the winter, spring,
summer and fall for each species. The relationships between species mean
values of drought frequency during each season and life habitat (annual
or perennial) were tested using Firth's penalized-likelihood logistic
regressions. Because demographic histories caused by ancestry can
confound trait - environment associations, we then tested for the
relationships between drought frequeny and life history while
controlling for relationships between species using phylogenetic
logistic regressions.

\hypertarget{collection-dates}{%
\subsubsection{Collection dates}\label{collection-dates}}

To test the hypothesis that annual species have adapted to escape
drought prone seasons as seeds, collection dates for herbarium specimens
were compared between annual and perennial species. Comparisons of
distributions were made by Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, t-test,
and Barlett variance test.

Out of 8670 \emph{Heliophila} GBIF recrods, 6634 were for species with
reported life history (Mummenhoff et al., 2005), 3653 had geospatial
data, 3627 did not have geospatial issues, 3460 were located on pixels
classified as land having drought measurements, 3457 were located in
Africa, 3162 were not duplicated. After all filtering steps, 2192
records for 42 species (Figure \ref{fig:phylogeny}, Table
\ref{tab:speciesmeanstable}) passed for further analyses. The number of
samples varied between species, with a mean of 52.19 samples per
species. Heliophila rigidiuscula had the most records, 201, and
Heliophila cornellsbergia the fewest, 2 (Table
\ref{tab:speciesmeanstable}).

There were clear visual differences between the distributions of the 960
annual and the 1232 perennial \emph{Heliophila} observation records (see
Figure \ref{fig:speciesmaps} for maps of individual species). While
annual species were generally found in the western regions of South
Africa and the Namibia, primarily in the Cape Floristic Region and
Succulent Karoo (Figure \ref{fig:mapsboxplots}a), the occurances of
perennials extended to the east coast of South Africa (Figure
\ref{fig:mapsboxplots}b).

The frequency of drought varied considerably across the ranges of
\emph{Heliophila} species (Figure \ref{fig:mapsboxplots}c-f). This
heterogeneity is expected, given that this is one of the most
climatically diverse regions of the Earth (Sayre et al., 2013). It is
worth noting the east to west cline in drought frequency observed during
the summer, which distinguishes the high drought frequency of the
Kalahari Sands and Namid Destert phyotogeographic regions from the low
drought frequency of the Drakensberg Mountains and Coastal Zambesian
phytogeographic regions. In the Cape phytogeographic region there was
finer scale heterogeneity in drought frequency during the summer.

Theory has predicted that annuality should be adaptive in places where
stresses such as drought are more common. Conversely, perenniality
should be adaptive in places where such stresses are less frequent. We
found that the frequency of drought was significantly higher at the
locations of occurance records for annual species. In terms of raw
observation records (Figure @\ref(fig:mapsboxplots)g), the frequency of
drought was signficantly higher at the location of annuals during the
winter (t = 10.65, p = 0.00), spring (t = 10.73, p = 0.00), summer (t =
12.67, p = 0.00), and fall (t = 15.26, p = 0.00). Because raw occurance
records do not account for variation in the number of records per
species (Table \ref{tab:speciesmeanstable})), we also tested whether
mean drought frequency values of each species were significantly
different between annuals and perennials by a Firths-penalized logistic
regression. We found that the mean drought frequencies were signficantly
higher (\(\alpha = 0.05\)) in annual species during the spring, summer,
and fall (Table \ref{tab:modelstable}, Figure \ref{fig:lineplots}a). We
further tested whether annual species are found in places where droughts
occur more frequently while controlling for the phylogentic relatedness
of \emph{Heliophila} species. This is important, because environmental
differences in species distributions can be confounded with demographic
history caused by acestry. We found that while controlling for
phylogeny, the mean drought frequencies were signficantly higher
(\(\alpha = 0.05\)) in annual species during the spring, summer, and
fall (Table \ref{tab:modelstable}, Figure \ref{fig:lineplots}a). These
findings indicate that common acestry alone does not explain differences
the drought frequencies experienced in the environemnts of annual and
perennial \emph{Heliophila}.

The preceding results indicated that annual speices are found in
environments where droughts are signifacantly more frequent, especially
in the summer and fall. Classic life history theory hypothesizes that
annuality reflects adaptation to such environments because it allows
species to escape stressful conditions. If this is the case, we would
expect that annuals spend the drought prone seasons of summer and fall
as seeds. To test this hypothesis, we compared the dates of occurance
records between annual and perennial \emph{Heliophila} species. The
distributions reveal a considerable difference in the timing of
observation of these two life histories. In comparison to perennials,
which appear to be collected throughout the year, annuals are almost
exclusively observed during the spring (Figure \ref{fig:lineplots}b).
The differences between the distrubution of collection dates were
signicant by all tests (ks.test D = 0.25, p = 0; bartlett.test K2 =
503.18, p = 0.00) This is consistent with a model of life history in
which annual species flower in the spring, set seed, senesce, and die
before the summer. Thus, these annual species are likely to remain
dormant during the summer and fall, when drought is the strongest
predictor of the distrubutions of annual and perennial life histories
(Figure \ref{fig:lineplots}a).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

To test the hypothesis that annual and perennial plants reflect
adaptation to alternative drought environments we examined the landscape
distribution of life history strategies in the large and diverse mustard
genus, \emph{Heliophila}. Using metadata of 2192 occurance records and a
34 year dataset of satellite-detected droughts, we tested the prediction
that annual species are more often observed in drought-prone locations
than perennial species, when controlling for phylogenetic relatedness.
We found that drought frequency is significantly different between the
distributions of annual and perennial species, with annuals being found
in environments with more frequent drought, and that this signal is
strongest during the summer. These results remain significant while
controlling for the phylogenetic relationships of \emph{Heliophila}
species, yielding support for the role that natural selection has played
in driving contemporary distributions of these alternatives strategies
in relation to drought regimes.

We cannot elimiate the possibility that counfounding traits or
environmental variables are the causative factors explaining variation
in the distributions of annual and perennial species. Nevertheless,
these results reveal quantitative support for the classic prediction
that annual species are found in environemnts that experience more
frequent drought than perennial species. These findings complement
previous reports of qualitative associations between annaulity with
enviroments characterized as having increased aridity (Evans et al.,
2005), alternative precipitation defined habitats (Datson et al., 2008;
Morishima et al., 1984), or greater unpredictability (Cruz-Mazo et al.,
2009). However, to our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate
a signficant association between life history and drought in a
phylogenetic context informed by large scale species distribution data
and long term drought measures.

Unfortunately, herbarium collections and their associated data do not
represent systematic or random sampling of a species distribution.
Significant biases in collecting exist, which we have not necessarily
controlled for here, and may have some effect on our findings, such as a
bias toward collecting near roads or near the locations of natural
history collections (Daru et al., 2018). Future research will benefit
from systematic sampling efforts to avoid these noted biases. However,
the ecosystems of southern Africa include several biodiversity hotspots
and are among the most botanically well sampled regions on Earth (Daru
et al., 2018), suggesting that this may currently be the optimal region
for our analyses of life history distribution. Indeed, we were able to
use 2192 occurance records to study 42 species, which represents a
significant advance over relying on personal observations to
characterize species distrubtuions.

These findings support classical theoretical predictions about the
adaptive value of annual and perennial life history strategies. Taken
together, they suggest that in \emph{Heliophila}, annual species are
adapted to environments with increased summer droughts by avoiding these
seasons in a dormant seed phase of their life cycle. They also suggest
that perenniality is adaptive in environemnts where droughts are less
frequent. While most previous work has focused on describing the
evolutionary origins of annuality (Andreasen \& Baldwin, 2001; Barrett
et al., 1996; Conti, Soltis, Hardig, \& Schneider, 1999; Friedman \&
Rubin, 2015; Verboom, Linder, \& Stock, 2004) there are at least a few
other cases where perenniality appears to have arisen from an annual
acestor (Bena, Lejeune, Prosperi, \& Olivieri, 1998; Tank \& Olmstead,
2008). And while early theory predicted selection for annuality when
adult morality is high (Stearns, 1992), we also find evidence that the
transition to perenniality could be explained by historical drought
regimes. The phylogeny reveals several transitions from annual to
perennial life history (Figure \ref{fig:phylogeny}a) and that perennials
distributions extend into regions where drought frequency is low (Figure
\ref{fig:mapsboxplots}b,Figure \ref{fig:speciesmaps}). Perennials may be
able to out complete annual relatives in environments where the
infrequency of drought favors strategies that allow plants to benefit
from growth over many seasons. It may also indicate that annuals rely on
drought as a source of disturbance for seedling recruitment when
competing with perennials (Corbin \& D'Antonio, 2004). Indeed, no annual
species were observed in the low drought regions of east South Africa
\ref{fig:mapsboxplots}a,Figure \ref{fig:speciesmaps}).

These findings suggest that species with locally adapted life history
strategies could be threatened by rapidly changing drought regimes (Dai,
2011). This could have impacts on ecosystem functioning if the
composition of annual and perennial species changes as a response
(Garnier, Cordonnier, Guillerm, \& Sonié, 1997; Roumet, Urcelay, \&
Dı'az, 2006). Furthermore, the frequency of drought may be an important
factor when considering the use of perennial cropping sysyems (Lelièvre
\& Volaire, 2009; Parry, Flexas, \& Medrano, 2005).

In conclusion, we find strong support for classic life history theory
which predicts that annuality is adaptive environments where droughts
occur more frequently. Additionally, we report evidence consistent with
a life history model in annuals in which they escape drought prone
seasons during the seed phase of their life cycle. Finally, we find
evidence that the distributions of perennial lineages may indicate a
competitive advantage in areas where droughts are infrequent. More
broadly, this work demonstrates the power of emerging data to address
outstanding classic hypotheses in ecology and evolution.
