\abstract{
Explaining variation in life history strategies is a long-standing goal
of evolutionary biology. For plants, annual and perennial life histories
are thought to reflect adaptation to environments that differ in the
frequency of stress events such as drought. Here we test this hypothesis
in \textit{Heliophila} (Brassicaceae), a diverse genus of flowering
plants native to Africa, by integrating 34 years of satellite-based
drought measurements with 2192 herbaria occurrence records. Consistent
with predictions from classic life history theory, we find that
perennial \textit{Heliophila} species occur in environments where
droughts are significantly less frequent compared to annuals. These
associations are predictive while controlling for phylogeny, lending
support to the hypothesis that drought related natural selection has
influenced the distributions of these strategies. Additionally, the
collection dates of annual and perennial species indicate that annuals
escape drought prone seasons during the seed phase of their life cycle.
Together, these finding provide empirical support for classic hypotheses
about the drivers of life history strategy in plants - that perennials
out compete annuals in environments with less frequent drought and that
annuals are adapted to environments with more frequent drought by
escaping drought prone seasons as seeds.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Understanding the causes and consequences of life history variation is a
longstanding goal of ecology and evolutionary biology (Cole, 1954). In
plants, life histories are especially diverse, with herbaceous species
that complete their life cycle in a number of weeks to trees that live
for thousands of years (Brown, 1996). Along this continuum an important
division exists, distinguishing annuals which complete their seed to
seed life cycle within a single calendar year from perennials which can
persist over multiple years. Annual plants flower once, set seed,
senesce, and then die, spending at least some portion of the year as a
seed, where they are relatively protected from environmental stress. In
contrast, perennial plants can continue vegetative growth after
reproduction and must survive conditions experienced during all seasons.
These represent fundamentally different life history strategies, but the
ecological factors that explain their evolution and distributions remain
empirically uresolved (Friedman \& Rubin, 2015).\\
Classical theory predict shorter life spans in environments where adult
mortality is high (Charnov \& Schaffer, 1973; Stearns, 1992; Franco \&
Silvertown, 1996). In plants, this has been extended to the hypothesis
that annuality is adaptive when it allows plants to escape drought
(Schaffer \& Gadgil, 1975). Lack of water is perhaps the greatest threat
to survival during vegetative or reproductive growth and annuals can
remain dormant (and protected as a seed) during drought. Thus,
environments with greater seasonal drought frequency may select for
annual life histories that complete reproduction prior to drought prone
seasons. Conversely, environments with less frequent drought may select
for perennial species, which may benefit from multiple bouts of
reproduction and competitive advantage by preventing recruitment of
annual species (Corbin \& D'Antonio, 2004). These predictions have been
supported by the observation of annuals in arid environments in
\emph{Oryza perennis} (Morishima \emph{et al.}, 1984) and
\emph{Oenothera} (Evans \emph{et al.}, 2005). Additionally, annual and
perennial species of \emph{Nemesia} were qualitatively associated with
winter rather and summer rainfall environments respectively (Datson
\emph{et al.}, 2008) and annual species of \emph{Scorzoneroides} were
associated with environments classified as unpredictable (Cruz-Mazo
\emph{et al.}, 2009). However, whether the history frequency of drought
events indeed predicts the distributions annual or perennial life
history strategies has yet to be tested.\\
Here we combine a long-term global dataset of satellite detected drought
events with metadata from natural history collections to test these
classic hypotheses within the African endemic mustard genus,
\emph{Heliophila} L. (Brassicaceae). If annuality is an adaptive
strategy allowing plants to escape drought prone seasons, then drought
frequency should predict the distribution of life history strategies
across landscapes, and annual species should be more commonly associated
with drought prone regions than perennial species. Furthermore, if
annual species have adapted to escape drought prone seasons,
observations of growing annual species (i.e.~occurring in forms other
than seed) should be rare during drought prone seasons. Phylogenetic
relatedness can influence tests of associations between species' traits
and their environments (Felsenstein, 1985; Barrett \emph{et al.}, 1996),
and therefore we assessed the relationship between life history
distribution and drought frequency in a phylogenetic context.

All analyses were performed using R. All data and the source code to
produce this manuscript are available at

\hypertarget{satellite-detected-drought-data}{%
\subsubsection{Satellite-detected drought
data}\label{satellite-detected-drought-data}}

Remotely sensed data is a powerful tool for characterizing seasonal
patterns in drought because it is less limited in spatial and temporal
scope and resolution than weather stations or field observations
(AghaKouchak \emph{et al.}, 2015). To quantify the frequency of drought
during different seasons across landscapes, we used the remotely sensed
Vegetative Health Index (VHI), which measures landscape scale reductions
in plant cover and temperature conditions characteristic of drought
(Kogan, 2001). Generated from data collected by NOAA AVHRR satellites
since 1981, the VHI combines Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
(NDVI) derived measures of vegetative stress (Vegetative Condition Index
- VCI) with temperature stress indicated by anomalies in thermal spectra
(Temperature Condition Index - TCI). The VHI of year \(y\) during week
\(w\) of \([1,52]\) at pixel \(i\) is derived from the following
equations, where \(n\) is the number of years observed.

\[VCI_{y,w,i} = 100\frac{NDVI_{y,w,i} - NDVI_{min}}{NDVI_{max} - NDVI_{min}}\]

\[TCI_{y,w,i} = 100\frac{T_{y,w,i} - T_{min}}{T_{max} - T_{min}}\]

\[VHI_{y,w,i} = 0.5(VCI_{y,w,i}) + 0.5(TCI_{y,w,i})\] where
\(NDVI_{min} = min(NDVI_{1981,w,i}...NDVI_{1981+n,w,i})\) and
\(NDVI_{max} = max(NDVI_{1981,w,i}...NDVI_{1981+n,w,i})\) and
\(T_{min} = min(T_{1981,w,i}...T_{1981+n,w,i})\) and
\(T_{max} = max(T_{1981,w,i}...T_{1981+n,w,i})\)

Thus, VHI measurements are standardized according to conditions
historically observed at each locations. These measurements have been
validated and generally used for evaluating drought risk and predicting
crop yields in agriculture (e.g., Rojas \emph{et al.}, 2011; Kogan
\emph{et al.}, 2016). But they also present a new tool to study seasonal
patterns in the frequency of drought across environments and to test
hypotheses about the effect of drought on ecological and evolutionary
processes (Kerr \& Ostrovsky, 2003). As such, the VHI has been applied
recently to study drought related ecology of natural species and proven
useful for predicting intraspecific variation in drought tolerance
traits and genes (Mojica \emph{et al.}, 2016; Dittberner \emph{et al.},
2018; Monroe \emph{et al.}, 2018b). Here, we accessed VHI data at
\(16km^2\) resolution from 1981 to 2015
(\url{https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/smcd/emb/vci/VH/vh_ftp.php}) to
characterize the seasonal drought frequencies experienced by annual and
perennial \emph{Heliophila} species.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Life history data for
\emph{Heliophila}}{Life history data for Heliophila}}\label{life-history-data-for-heliophila}}

\emph{Heliophila} is a genus of flowering plants endemic to the southern
portion of Africa including the Cape Floristic and Succulent Karoo
Regions. These are among the most botanically diverse environments on
Earth and the \emph{Heliophila} species occurring there are considered
to make up the most diverse genus of the family Brassicaceae (Mummenhoff
\emph{et al.}, 2005; Mandáková \emph{et al.}, 2012). This genus includes
both perennial and annual species and this change in life history
strategy has likely arisen multiple independent times (Appel \&
Al-Shehbaz, 1997; Mummenhoff \emph{et al.}, 2005). Furthermore, the fine
scale climatic heterogeneity of Southern Africa is ideal for studying
the distribution of traits in relation to environmental parameters
(Sayre \emph{et al.}, 2013). We used life histories reported by
Mummenhoff \emph{et al.} (2005), grouping species with annual or
perennial life histories. Perenniality was defined based any form of
perennial life history (e.g., herbs, shrubs, mixed, etc). Because the
nature of species reported with mixed traits were unknown
(i.e.~plasticity vs.~genetic variation), we classified these species
here as perennial since they can maintain vegetative growth after
reproduction at least to some capacity.

\hypertarget{heliophila-occurrence-records}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Heliophila} occurrence
records}{Heliophila occurrence records}}\label{heliophila-occurrence-records}}

Botanists have collected and maintained over 350 million botanical
specimens worldwide over the past 300 years. Herbarium specimens and
their associated metadata have been used since the 1960s to study
species' geographical distributions (reviewed by Willis \emph{et al.}
(2017) and Lang \emph{et al.} (2018)). And as they become digitized
(Soltis, 2017), these collections have been used to study relationships
between trait distributions, geography, and climate (Davis \emph{et
al.}, 2015; Stropp \emph{et al.}, 2016; Wolf \emph{et al.}, 2016;
Václavı'k \emph{et al.}, 2017). To characterize the distributions of
annual and perennial \emph{Heliophila} species, all records for the
genus \emph{Heliophila} were downloaded from the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (gbif.org) on July 21, 2018 (GBIF, 2018).

\hypertarget{sequence-data-for-phylogeny}{%
\subsubsection{Sequence data for

An alignment of ITS I and II sequences for \emph{Heliophila} species was
obtained from the authors of Mandáková \emph{et al.} (2012). Individual
ITS I and II sequences for \emph{Aethionema grandiflorum, Alliaria
petiolata, Cardamine matthioli, Chamira circaeoides}, and \emph{Rorippa
amphibia} were downloaded from Genbank.

\hypertarget{drought-frequency-calculations}{%
\subsubsection{Drought frequency
calculations}\label{drought-frequency-calculations}}

To characterize drought regimens across the distributions of annual and
perennial species of \emph{Heliophila}, we calculated drought during
different seasons at the location of observations for \emph{Heliophila}
records using the VHI. Specifically, we created global maps of the
frequencies of observing drought conditions (VHI\textless{}40, NOAA)
during the winter (quarter surrounding winter solstice), spring (quarter
surrounding spring equinox), summer (quarter surrounding summer
solstice) and fall (quarter surrounding fall equinox) from 1981 to 2015.
From these maps, the drought frequency during the winter, spring,
summer, and fall were extracted for the locations of all GBIF records.

\hypertarget{filtering-of-occurrence-records}{%
\subsubsection{Filtering of occurrence
records}\label{filtering-of-occurrence-records}}

To avoid instances with spurious location data, we filtered raw GBIF by
restricting our analyses to include only:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  records for species with reported life history\\
\item
  records with geospatial data\\
\item
  records without known geospatial coordinate issues (i.e., coordinates
  reported are those of herbarium)\\
\item
  records from collection sites classified as land pixels\\
\item
  records from Africa (to exclude locations of cultivation)
\item
  records without duplicates (i.e., identical species, location,
  collection date)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{phylogeny-construction}{%
\subsubsection{Phylogeny construction}\label{phylogeny-construction}}

Out group ( \emph{Aethionema grandiflorum, Alliaria petiolata, Cardamine
matthioli, Chamira circaeoides}, and \emph{Rorippa amphibia}) and
ingroup \emph{Heliophila} ITS I and II sequences were aaligned using
MAFFT (Katoh \emph{et al.}, 2002) with strategy G-INS-I, offset value
0.1, and all other options set as default. The \(GTR + \Gamma\) model of
nucleotide substitution was determined to best fit the data based on AIC
using jModelTest2 (Guindon \& Gascuel, 2003; Darriba \emph{et al.},
2012). A maximum clade credibility tree with branch lengths as relative
time was estimated by summarizing data from six runs of 100,000,000
generations of Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo conducted in BEAST 2
(Bouckaert \emph{et al.}, 2014). Model selection and phylogenetic
analyses were conducted through the CIPRES Science Gateway (Miller
\emph{et al.}, 2010).

\subsubsection{Comparison of drought frequency between annual and
perennial
species}\label{comparison-of-drought-frequency-between-annual-and-perennial-species}}

To evaluate the hypothesis that annual and perennial life history
strategies reflect adaptations to alternative drought regimes, we tested
the corresponding prediction that the observed distributions of annual
and perennial \emph{Heliophila} species would be significantly
associated with historic drought frequency. First, we compared the
frequency of drought during the winter, spring, summer, and fall between
raw occurrence records of annual and perennial species by t-tests. To
account for variation in the number of occurrence records per species,
we next calculated the mean drought frequency during the winter, spring,
summer and fall for each species. Because shared evolutionary history of
closely related species can lead to spurious associations between traits
and environments (Felsenstein, 1985), we tested for a relationship
between life history strategy and drought frequency while controlling
for phylogeny using phylogenetic logistic regression (Ives \& Garland,
2010).

\hypertarget{collection-dates}{%
\subsubsection{Collection dates}\label{collection-dates}}

To test the hypothesis that annual species have adapted to escape
drought prone seasons as seeds, collection dates for herbarium specimens
were compared between annual and perennial species. Comparisons of
distributions were made by Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and
Barlett variance test.

\end{figure}

Out of 8670 \emph{Heliophila} GBIF records, 6634 were for species with
reported life history (Mummenhoff \emph{et al.}, 2005), 2856 had
geospatial data, 2833 did not have geospatial issues, 2684 were located
on pixels classified as land having drought measurements, 2543 were
located in Africa, 2192 were not duplicated. Thus, after all filtering
steps, 2192 records for 42 species (Figure \ref{fig:phylogeny}, Table
\ref{tab:speciesmeanstable}) passed for further analyses. The number of
samples varied between species, with a mean of 52.19 samples per
species. Heliophila rigidiuscula had the most records, 201, and
Heliophila cornellsbergia the fewest, 2 (Table
\ref{tab:speciesmeanstable}).

There were clear visual differences between the distributions of the 960
annual and the 1232 perennial \emph{Heliophila} observation records (see
Figure \ref{fig:speciesmaps} for maps of individual species). While
annual species were generally found in the western regions of South
Africa and Namibia, primarily in the Cape Floristic Region and Succulent
Karoo (Figure \ref{fig:mapsboxplots}a), the occurrence of perennials
extended to the east coast of South Africa (Figure
\ref{fig:mapsboxplots}b).

The frequency of drought varied considerably across the ranges of
\emph{Heliophila} species (Figure \ref{fig:mapsboxplots}c-f). This
heterogeneity is expected, given that this is one of the most
climatically diverse regions of the Earth (Sayre \emph{et al.}, 2013).
It is worth noting the east to west cline in drought frequency observed
during the summer, which distinguishes the high drought frequency of the
Kalahari Sands and Namid Desert phytogeographic regions from the low
drought frequency of the Drakensberg Mountains and Coastal Zambesian
phytogeographic regions. In the Cape phytogeographic region there was
finer scale heterogeneity in drought frequency during the summer.

Theory predicts that annuality should be adaptive in places where
stresses such as drought are more common. Conversely, perenniality
should be adaptive in places where such stresses are less frequent. We
found that the frequency of drought was significantly higher at the
locations of occurrence records for annual species. In terms of raw
observation records (Figure \ref{fig:mapsboxplots}g), the frequency of
drought was significantly higher at the location of annuals during the
winter (t = 10.65, p = 0.00), spring (t = 10.73, p = 0.00), summer (t =
12.67, p = 0.00), and fall (t = 15.26, p = 0.00). Because raw occurrence
records do not account for variation in the number of records per
species (Table \ref{tab:speciesmeanstable}) or species relatedness
(Figure \ref{fig:phylogeny}a), we also tested whether mean drought
frequency values of each species were significantly different between
annuals and perennials using phylogenetic logistic regression. We found
that the mean drought frequencies were significantly higher
(\(\alpha = 0.05\)) in annual species during the spring, summer, and
fall (Table \ref{tab:modelstable}, Figure \ref{fig:lineplots}a). These
findings indicate that common acestry alone does not explain differences
the drought frequencies experienced in the environments of annual and
perennial \emph{Heliophila}.

\end{figure}

The preceding results indicated that annual species are found in
environments where droughts are significantly more frequent, especially
in the summer and fall. Classic life history theory hypothesizes that
annuality reflects adaptation to such environments because it allows
species to escape stressful conditions. If this is the case, we would
expect that annuals spend the drought prone seasons of summer and fall
as seeds. To test this hypothesis, we compared the dates of occurrence
records between annual and perennial \emph{Heliophila} species. The
distributions reveal a considerable difference in the timing of
observation of these two life histories. In comparison to perennials,
which appear to be collected throughout the year, annuals are almost
exclusively observed during the winter and spring (Figure
\ref{fig:lineplots}b). The differences between the distribution of
collection dates were significant by all tests (ks.test D = 0.25, p = 0;
bartlett.test K2 = 503.18, p = 0.00) This is consistent with a model of
life history in which annual species flower in the spring, set seed,
senesce, and die before the summer. Thus, these annual species are
likely to remain dormant during the summer and fall, when drought is the
strongest predictor of the distributions of annual and perennial life
histories (Figure \ref{fig:lineplots}a).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

To test the hypothesis that annual and perennial plants reflect
adaptation to alternative drought environments we examined the landscape
distribution of life history strategies in the large and diverse mustard
genus, \emph{Heliophila}. Using metadata of 2192 occurrence records and
a 34 year dataset of satellite-detected droughts, we tested the
prediction that annual species are more often observed in drought-prone
locations than perennial species, when controlling for phylogenetic
relatedness. We found that drought frequency is significantly different
between the distributions of annual and perennial species, with annuals
being found in environments with more frequent drought, and that this
signal is strongest during the seasons when annuals are likely escaping
via seed dormancy. These results remain significant while controlling
for the phylogenetic relationships of \emph{Heliophila} species,
yielding support for the role that natural selection has played in
driving contemporary distributions of these alternatives strategies in
relation to drought regimens.

We cannot eliminate the possibility that confounding traits or
environmental variables are the causative factors explaining variation
in the distributions of annual and perennial species. Nevertheless,
these results provide quantitative support for the classic prediction
that annual species are found in environemnts that experience more
frequent drought than perennial species. These findings complement
previous reports of qualitative associations between annuality with
enviroments characterized as having increased aridity (Evans \emph{et
al.}, 2005), alternative precipitation defined habitats (Morishima
\emph{et al.}, 1984; Datson \emph{et al.}, 2008), or greater
unpredictability (Cruz-Mazo \emph{et al.}, 2009). However, to our
knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a significant
association between life history and drought in a phylogenetic context
informed by large scale species distribution data and long term drought
measures.

Unfortunately, herbarium collections and their associated data do not
represent systematic or random sampling of a species distribution.
Significant biases in collecting exist, which we have not necessarily
controlled for here, and may have some effect on our findings, such as a
bias toward collecting near roads or near the locations of natural
history collections (Daru \emph{et al.}, 2018). Future research will
benefit from systematic sampling efforts to avoid these noted biases.
However, the ecosystems of southern Africa include several biodiversity
hotspots and are among the most botanically well sampled regions on
Earth (Daru \emph{et al.}, 2018), suggesting that this may currently be
the optimal region for our analyses of life history distribution.
Indeed, we were able to use 2192 occurrence records to study 42 species,
which represents a significant advance over relying on personal
observations to characterize species distributions.

These findings support classical theoretical predictions about the
adaptive value of annual and perennial life history strategies. Taken
together, they suggest that in \emph{Heliophila}, annual species are
adapted to environments with increased summer droughts by avoiding these
seasons in a dormant seed phase of their life cycle. They also suggest
that perenniality is adaptive in environemnts where droughts are less
frequent. While most previous work has focused on describing the
evolutionary origins of annuality (Barrett \emph{et al.}, 1996; Conti
\emph{et al.}, 1999; Andreasen \& Baldwin, 2001; Verboom \emph{et al.},
2004; Friedman \& Rubin, 2015) there are at least a few other cases
where perenniality appears to have arisen from an annual ancestor (Bena
\emph{et al.}, 1998; Tank \& Olmstead, 2008). And while early theory
predicted selection for annuality when adult morality is high (Stearns,
1992), we also find evidence that the transition to perenniality could
be explained by the historical frequency of drought, a likely cause of
mortality in plants. The phylogeny reveals several transitions from
annual to perennial life history (Figure \ref{fig:phylogeny}a) and that
the distributions of perennial \emph{Heliophila} extend into regions
where drought frequency is low (Figure \ref{fig:mapsboxplots}b, Figure
\ref{fig:speciesmaps}). Perennials may be able to out complete annual
relatives in environments where the infrequency of drought favors
strategies that allow plants to benefit from growth over many seasons.
It may also indicate that annuals rely on drought as a source of
disturbance for seedling recruitment when competing with perennials
(Corbin \& D'Antonio, 2004). Indeed, no annual species were observed in
the low drought regions of eastern South Africa (Figure
\ref{fig:mapsboxplots}, Figure \ref{fig:speciesmaps}).

These findings suggest that species with locally adaptive life history
strategies could be threatened by rapidly changing drought regimens
(Dai, 2011). This could have impacts on ecosystem functioning and
processes such as carbon cycling if life history traits evolve or the
composition of annual and perennial species changes in response (Garnier
\emph{et al.}, 1997; Roumet \emph{et al.}, 2006; Monroe \emph{et al.},
2018a). Furthermore, the frequency of drought may be an important factor
when considering the use of perennial cropping systems (Parry \emph{et
al.}, 2005; Lelièvre \& Volaire, 2009).

In conclusion, we find strong support for classic life history theory
which predicts that annuality is adaptive in environments where droughts
occur more frequently. Additionally, we report evidence consistent with
a life history model in annuals in which they escape drought prone
seasons during the seed phase of their life cycle. Finally, we find
evidence that the distributions of perennial lineages may indicate a
competitive advantage in areas where droughts are infrequent. More
broadly, this work highlights the irreplaceable value of natural history
collections and demonstrates the power of combining such information
with large scale remote sensing data to address outstanding classic
hypotheses in ecology and evolution.
